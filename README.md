# CouchPotato

CouchPotato is a behavorial web-application built using the jsPsych library. What this application aims to accomplish is to see if there are differences in the way we understand placements of specific adjectives within a given passage. For example, take the adjective + noun phrase (dirty red car). Would a participant prefer this specific adjective placement or would they prefer "red dirty car"?
